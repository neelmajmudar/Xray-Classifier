## About

Xray Classifier is a deep learning-powered tool for detecting abnormalities in chest X-ray images. Built with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and trained on labeled medical datasets, this model helps automate the identification of pathologies such as pneumonia, COVID-19, or None.

It aims to support radiologists and healthcare professionals by providing rapid image classification that can assist in triaging or flagging critical cases.

## Features

- **CNN-based Image Classifier**  
  Uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture implemented in `XrayClassifier.py` for robust and efficient image classification.

- **Pretrained Model Support**  
  Easily extendable to integrate pretrained models using transfer learning techniques.

- **Real-time Inference**  
  Classify X-ray images directly through a browser interface powered by Streamlit via `XrayApp.py`.

- **Model Performance Metrics**  
  Training/validation accuracy and loss visualized through:
  - `Training&ValidationAccuracy.png`
  - `Training&ValidationLoss.png`
  - `ConfusionMatrixActualvPredicted.png`

- **Testing Output Visualization**  
  Includes `testpredict.png` as a sample model inference result.

- **Modular and Extensible**  
  Codebase is designed to easily modify model structure, optimizer, or add support for Grad-CAM visualizations and multi-class classification.
